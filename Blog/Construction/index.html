        Making a website isn't easy work at all. I had to buy a domain (I used nexint.xyz), but at the time, this required
        phone number verification to make this happen. At the time of domain registration, I was unable to use my phone number
        (as I was not locoated in the country my phone number was in). I had to use roaming to receive ONE text message
        to register this domain.
        
        <br><br>Hosting was much easier, as a friend of mine found that Github pages worked well for their static website.
        I may eventually upgrade from Github Pages, but for now, this website service seems to be working quite well.

        <br><br>Another pain was domain linking, as I had to link my domain over to my website at github. However, this
        wasn't that bad, and I was actually able to link the website successfully without things breaking.
        Might be noteworthy if someone tries to do what I am doing.

      <p class="desctext">
        This website was constructed using a lot of HTML, CSS and JS. I had to manually learn CSS and HTML from the internet, and
        I personally stole a lot of Javascript code to make this possible from websites like StackOverflow and W3pages.
        
        <br><br>Building a website isn't easy work, especially if you are limited to manually coding your website
        with html, css and javascript, but this system allows for a lot of customizability, including drop down menues
        that are in extensive use on my blog, legal pages, and even this blogpost right here.

    </button>
    <div class="content" style="height:200px;">
      <p class="desctext">
        This page had multiple pain points while I was building this website, notably Div centering, and a bit more.
        Div centering is one of the hardest things when writing a pure HTML / CSS / JS website, and it's also what I had to
        primairly google and steal code for most of the time.

        <br><br>Another notable pain point was using javascript and css for any form of animation.
        Animations are pretty difficult to code, and I didn't have a fun time trying to code the animation for the
        scroll blurring animationn on our main landing page. I also didn't have a great time trying to code the
        animation for when you launch the landing webpage, as everything loads.

        <br><br>Coding these drop down menues also wasn't exactly easy, especially with scroll breaking every so often.
        Scrollbars on Firefox aren't that customizable for devs, so you won't see scrollbars on these drop down menues on Firefox.
        This is a firefox limitation, and most other browsers work just fine, including any webkit browser.

        I honestly built this website as I didn't like big platforms trying to censor what I want to say in the internet.
        The internet should be open for individuals to make their own individual spaces on the internet, and not
        monopolized by major corporations trying to sell your data to big tech.

        <br><br>Shameless self plug: I may end up trying to build my own custom forum space once I become popular enough on YT.
        We refuse to sell your data to any third party advertisers, however we may use generic banner ads to fund our website in the future.
